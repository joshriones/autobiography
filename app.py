    I was born in Greenhills, San Fernando, Cebu, far from the bustling city life, where I spent most of my childhood exploring nature and developing a deep appreciation for the outdoors. Growing up, I was always curious about how things worked and would often take things apart to understand their inner mechanisms. Whether it was a toy, a gadget, or even a simple household item, I was fascinated by the idea of how pieces came together to form a functioning whole. This innate curiosity laid the foundation for my passion for learning and discovery, guiding me through my educational journey and into the career path I would eventually pursue.

Despite the rural setting, my childhood was rich with experiences that shaped my character and values. The close-knit community and strong family bonds taught me the importance of relationships, responsibility, and perseverance. Ever since, I have always seek new knowledge and  strive for excellence.

As I grew older, my interests expanded beyond the confines of my small town. I developed a keen interest in technology and science, inspired by the endless possibilities they offered to solve real-world problems. This passion eventually led me to pursue formal education in these fields which I am currently taking (BSIT), marking the beginning of an exciting journey that would take me far from my humble beginnings.
